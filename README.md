# ☕ Wamokech - Modern Coffee Shop POS System

## 📖 About the Project
Wamokech is a complete, modern, and easy-to-use Point of Sale (POS) application designed specifically to manage coffee shop operations. It was developed as an end-of-studies project for a Computer Technician diploma. It replaces traditional cash registers with a fast, responsive web interface that handles everything from taking orders to tracking inventory. 

## ✨ Key Features
* **Secure Staff Authentication:** Each employee has their own account to log in securely, keeping shop data protected.
* **Real-Time Dashboard:** Provides an instant overview of the day's activity, including total daily sales, average order value, and the most popular items.
* **Fast Order Processing:** An intuitive, visually-driven menu interface allows staff to add items with a single click, automatically updating the bill in real-time.
* **Flexible Payments & Receipts:** Supports both cash and card payments, automatically calculates change due, allows for custom discounts, and generates professional receipts that can be printed or downloaded.
* **Inventory Management:** Tracks stock levels for crucial ingredients (like robusta and arabica coffee beans) and alerts staff when supplies are running low to prevent stockouts.
* **Customer Loyalty Tracking:** Saves customer profiles and remembers their purchase history, allowing the shop to track total spending for regular visitors.

## 💻 Technologies Used
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** For a responsive, accessible, and modern user interface (inspired by Stripe/Figma standards).
* **JavaScript:** The core engine handling all application logic, data processing, and user interactivity.
* **Local Storage:** Enables offline mode and fast data persistence directly in the browser without needing an external database.

## 🚀 Future Perspectives
The next major step for Wamokech is to connect the system to the internet, allowing it to synchronize data across multiple cash registers simultaneously.
