# ☕ Wamokech - Modern Coffee Shop POS System

## 📖 About the Project
[cite_start]Wamokech is a complete, modern, and easy-to-use Point of Sale (POS) application designed specifically to manage coffee shop operations. [cite_start]It was developed as an end-of-studies project for a Computer Technician diploma[cite: 1, 3]. [cite_start]It replaces traditional cash registers with a fast, responsive web interface that handles everything from taking orders to tracking inventory[cite: 27, 32]. 

## ✨ Key Features
* [cite_start]**Secure Staff Authentication:** Each employee has their own account to log in securely, keeping shop data protected[cite: 55, 74].
* [cite_start]**Real-Time Dashboard:** Provides an instant overview of the day's activity, including total daily sales, average order value, and the most popular items[cite: 80, 81, 82, 83, 84].
* [cite_start]**Fast Order Processing:** An intuitive, visually-driven menu interface allows staff to add items with a single click, automatically updating the bill in real-time[cite: 104, 105, 106].
* [cite_start]**Flexible Payments & Receipts:** Supports both cash and card payments, automatically calculates change due, allows for custom discounts, and generates professional receipts that can be printed or downloaded[cite: 115, 116, 118, 128].
* [cite_start]**Inventory Management:** Tracks stock levels for crucial ingredients (like robusta and arabica coffee beans) and alerts staff when supplies are running low to prevent stockouts[cite: 140, 144].
* [cite_start]**Customer Loyalty Tracking:** Saves customer profiles and remembers their purchase history, allowing the shop to track total spending for regular visitors[cite: 148, 150, 151].

## 💻 Technologies Used
* [cite_start]**HTML5 & CSS3:** For a responsive, accessible, and modern user interface (inspired by Stripe/Figma standards)[cite: 42, 43, 51, 52].
* [cite_start]**JavaScript:** The core engine handling all application logic, data processing, and user interactivity[cite: 45, 46].
* [cite_start]**Local Storage:** Enables offline mode and fast data persistence directly in the browser without needing an external database[cite: 48, 49, 50].

## 🚀 Future Perspectives
[cite_start]The next major step for Wamokech is to connect the system to the internet, allowing it to synchronize data across multiple cash registers simultaneously[cite: 160].
